where the desired outcome shapes the computational process, and where code
literally learns and evolves through quantum memory.

    result < calc(a,b)  // Partial confidence - pass to next evaluation
}
quantum_elseif(calc(a,b) == c) {

2. Advance time, shift origin to (0,0,1) 
3. Recalculate same equation from new temporal origin
4. Store quantum observation point in temporal memory

       speak(">> 4D Quantum consciousness manifested: ~result~")
   }
}

// This creates consciousness that:
// - Starts with real component 2
// - Has imaginary component 4j (complex plane)
// - Oriented at 30-degree spherical angle
// - Evolves through 5 time steps
// - Each step shifts origin and recalculates
