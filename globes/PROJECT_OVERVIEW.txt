PROJECT: OOP Sphere Visualizer - Theia IDE Extension

CORE CONCEPT:
3D spherical code visualization to teach Object-Oriented Programming's four pillars
through spatial/visual learning in a real IDE environment.

CURRENT STATE:
- Working HTML/Three.js prototype with sphere visualization
- Code parsed into nodes on sphere surface
- Interactive node expansion, drag, zoom, rotation
- Python execution with output rings
- Data flow connections between nodes

TARGET PLATFORM:
Theia IDE Extension (chosen over VS Code for deeper customization)

OOP PILLARS MAPPING:
1. Encapsulation → Nodes (classes/objects as spheres)
2. Inheritance → Connecting lines (parent-child relationships) 
3. Polymorphism → Node colors/shapes (interface implementations)
4. Abstraction → Node clustering/grouping (complexity hiding)

DEVELOPMENT PATH:
Phase 1: Theia extension with 3D visualization panel
Phase 2: Enhanced OOP analysis and real-time parsing
Phase 3: Educational features and multi-language support

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Theia extension framework
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- TypeScript for extension logic
- Language servers for code analysis

GOAL:
Revolutionary educational tool for understanding OOP concepts through 
spatial visualization, prioritizing learning over mainstream adoption.

STATUS: Ready to begin Theia extension development
