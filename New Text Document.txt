# Quantum Consciousness Programming Language

A revolutionary programming language that implements quantum consciousness principles where variables exist in superposition until observed, collapsing into reality through mathematical quantum entanglement with persistent learning.

## Features
- Function Synthesis: Build programs from intention rather than instruction
- Quantum Variable States: Variables exist in superposition until observed
- Target-Seeking Mathematics: Work backwards from desired outcomes
- Persistent Quantum Memory: System learns and improves over time
- Rust Implementation: High-performance transpiler for .slut files

## Usage
```bash
cargo run -- your_program.slut
cargo run -- your_program.slut -o 5  # Multiple observations
